To have a working Stratos deployment with Puppet, you need to prepare your environment prior to the deployment. 
Even though you can automate that with Puppet, for this deployment you’ll need to do the following to setup the environment.

1. Install and configure Puppet agent on target hosts
2. Install Java and set JAVA_HOME to /opt/java and set PATH accordingly.

	# cd /opt
	# ./jdk-XXX-linux-x64.bin
	# ln -s /opt/jdkX.X.X /opt/java
	# export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java
	# export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

3. Host downloaded Stratos packs and their MD5 hashes from the Oxygentank and make those available to the deployment through HTTP.

Setting up the DB server
=========================

Install MySQL server, copy the provided db_setup.zip and modify db_init.sh accordingly. 
Run db_init.sh against the DB server. Make sure that the DB server is configured to accept remote connections.

Setting up the Puppet Master node
==================================

It’s easier for you have a separate environment for WSO2 Stratos if you already have a Puppet setup. 
Otherwise you can simply point manifestdir, modulepath and templatedir directory parameters to the provided directories accordingly.

Before you deploy
==================

Open manifests/nodes.pp and change parameters in the confignode section to match with your deployment. 
The provided nodes.pp is designed to run the deployment on 2 nodes (StratosnodeA and StratosnodeB) with 2 Load Balancers 
at each node fronting services running on that node. If you need to expand the deployment you can do so by modifying the nodes.pp accordingly.

Also the services are not in the maintenance mode in the provided nodes.pp. That needs to be in that state as you’ll be deploying 
WSO2 Stratos for the first time. Once deployed, you can set the maintenance_mode to true so that in the next maintenance cycle, 
it’ll just look for new patches and configuration updates.


	class { "stratos_as":
            	offset => 1,
               	tribes_port => 4100,
            	config_db => "appserver_config",
               	maintenance_mode => "true",
               	stage => "deploy",
 	}

Also you need to set the server_ip with the IP address of the target host. 
This requires to add some local hosts entries and find the target path of the deployment.

 	$server_ip = "192.168.4.111"


Change the load balancer parameters to front necessary services according to your deployment.

	class {"stratos_lb":
               	fronted_services  => ["appserver","identity","process","monitor","rule"],
               	stage => "deploy",
               	maintenance_mode => "true",
       	}

Change templates/hosts.erb accordingly so that service nodes don’t have to depend on any name-servers.

Change the $packs_repo to the repository you setup early with downloaded packs.

Now you can login to each target node and run puppetd -vt.

Maintaining the setup
======================

Once the deployment is done, there will be 2 scripts in /root/bin as puppet_clean.sh and puppet_init.sh in each node. 
You can run the puppet_clean.sh to clean the deployment in that particular node and using puppet_init.sh you can trigger the deployment. 
If you just run puppet_init.sh without any arguments, it’ll re-run the whole deployment for that node. 
Otherwise it’ll just invoke manifests related to the specified service without touching other running services in the node.

Syntax of the puppet_init.sh

puppet_init.sh <puppet_class_name | puppet_tag>

Enjoy!
